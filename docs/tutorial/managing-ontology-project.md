# Tutorial on Managing OBO Ontology Projects

This tutorial is not about editing ontologies and managing the evolution of their content (aka ontology curation), but the general process of managing an ontology project overall. In this lesson, we will cover the following:

1. How to effectively manage an ontology project using GitHub projects and teams
2. How to coordinate the evolution of ontologies across projects and grants

## Roles in OBO Ontology project management activities

1. *Ontology Curators*: manage the content of ontologies and interact with users
1. *Principal Ontology Curators*: coordinate the curation activities and have _always_ fixed hours assigned to the project.
1. *Ontology Pipeline Developers*: Manage the technical workflows around ontologies, such as release workflows, continuous integration and QC, and setting up data pipelines. Also helps with bulk editing activities.
1. *Principal Investigators*: Manage the projects that fund ontology curation activities.


For an effective management of an ontology, the following criteria are recommended:

1. There should be *at least one main Principal Ontology Curator* for every ontology project. The importance is not whether this curator has a specific number of hours per week allocated to the project (although based on our experience, 1 day per week is minimum), but whether the curator has a sense of ownership, i.e. they understand that they are the primary responsible person for maintaining the ontology moving forward. Because of potential grant overlapping issues, we recommend to have *at least 1 Principal Ontology Curator* for every grant/funded project that has a stake in the ontology.
2. Every effective ontology needs at least a few hours per week from an Ontology Pipeline Developer (OPD). More on that role later. The OPD does not always have as strong a sense of ownership of the ontology project, but typically has a strong sense of responsibility to members of the curation team.
3. There should be separate meetings for curation and technical activities - both problems are hard, and need different team members being present. We recommend at least monthly technical and biweekly curation calls, but for many of the most effective ontology projects we manage, weekly technical and weekly curation calls are normal.

Without the above minimum criteria, the following recommendations will be very hard to implement.

## What do we need? The Project Management Toolbox

Every ontology or group of related ontologies (sometimes it is easier to manage multiple ontologies at once, because their scope or technical workflows are quite uniform or they are heavily interrelated) should have:

1. *at least two teams*, Curation Team and Technical Team, with clearly defined members. We recommend to create two teams on GitHub and keep their members always up to date (i.e. remove members that are not actively participating). Many of our projects furthermore have a third "core team", which is a more liberal team containing everyone from stakeholders, principal investigators, curators and users.
2. *two distinct project boards*: One for the Curation Team, and one for the Technical Team. The details on how to design the boards is up to the respective teams, but we found a simple 4 stage board with sections for `To Do` (issues that are important but not urgent), `Priority` (issues that are important and urgent), `In Progress` (issues that are being worked on), `Under review` (issues that need review) and `Done` (finished issues) the most useful. The least useful column on a project board is `Backlog`, as it clutters the board and creates a massive overhead in the rare times the team meets to discuss the next steps.
3. *A documentation system* (often realised using `mkdocs` in OBO projects) with a page listing the members of the team. This page should provide links to all related team pages from Github and their project boards, as well as a table listing all current team members with the following information:
    - Name
    - ORCiD
    - Funding Information
    - Allocated FTEs (0 if on volunteering basis)
    - Associated teams
    - Role 
    - Responsibilities (What kind of issues can they be assigned to review? How are they involved in the Project?)

## Responsibilities

1. Effective Ontology Pipeline Developers (OPDs) are extremely rare and are typically active across many different projects. Therefore *their attention is scattered*. Understanding and accepting this is key for the following points.
1. Principal Investigators *explicitly assign target weekly hours* for Ontology Curators and Ontology Pipeline Developers to the project. These should be captured on the documentation systems team page (see above).
2. The Ontology Curators are responsible for the entire Curation Team Board and the `To Do` and `Priority` columns of the Technical Team. The later is important: it is the job of the curation team to _prioritise the technical issues_. The Technical Team can add tickets to the `To Do` and `Priority` columns, but this usually happens only in response to a request from the Curation Team.
3. When the technical team meets, the Principal Ontology Curator(s) (POC) are present, i.e. *the POCs are members of the technical team as well*. They will help clarifying the `Priority` tickets. The Technical Team is responsible to 
   - assign issues and reviewers among themselves (ideally, the reviewer should be decided at the same time the issue is assigned)
   - move issues from the `Priority` to the `In Progress` and later to the `Done` section.
   - communicate through the POC to the PIs when resources are insufficient to address `Priority` issues.

## Best Practices

- The `To Do` issues should first be moved to the `Priority` section before being addressed. This prevents focusing on easy to solve tickets in favour of important ones.
- Even if Google Docs are used to manage team meetings, at the end of each meetings *all open issues must be captured as GitHub tickets* and placed in the appropriate box on the board. We recommend that `Backlog` items are not added at all to the board - if they ever become important, they tend to resurface all by themselves.
- The single most important point of failure is the absence of an Principal Ontology Curator with a *strong sense of ownership*. This should be the projects priority to determine first.
- All new members of the project should undergo an onboarding. It is a good idea to prepare walkthroughs of the project (as video or pages in the documentation system) covering everything from Curation to Technical and Project Management.
